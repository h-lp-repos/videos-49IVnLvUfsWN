# Lesson 3: Implementing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) - Videos

This repository contains all of the materials for recording the six practical videos in Lesson 3: Implementing RAG.

## Structure

Each video lives in its own folder named in kebab-case:

- `video-1-environment-starter-quickstart/`: Environment setup and starter repo quickstart.
- `video-2-connect-vector-index/`: Connecting to a vector index and retrieving chunks with provenance.
- `video-3-prompt-construction-token-budget/`: Prompt construction and token-budget enforcement.
- `video-4-implement-reranker-thresholding/`: Relevance reranker implementation and thresholding.
- `video-5-caching-dedup-retrieval-optimization/`: Caching, deduplication, and retrieval optimizations.
- `video-6-end-to-end-demo-benchmark-failure-modes/`: End-to-end demo, micro‑benchmarking, and failure‑mode reproduction.

## Root Files

- `README.md`: This overview file (translated to English).
- `.gitignore`: Common patterns to ignore, updated for consistency.

*Follow the subfolders for each video-specific README, scripts, notebooks, assets, and verification artifacts.*
